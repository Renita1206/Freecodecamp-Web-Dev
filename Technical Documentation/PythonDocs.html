                    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                    It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but 
                    effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax 
                    and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, 
                    make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development 
                    in many areas on most platforms.
                </p>

                To get started with Python, write your first "Hello world" program in Python:
                <code
                >print("Hello, World")
                </code>

                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        
                <code>
                    if (condition):
                    [indent]statements
                    else:
                    [indent]statements
                </code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence.

                    The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. 
                    Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), 
                    or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), 
                    Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), 
                    in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example - 
            
                    <code>
                        for i in range(10):
                        [indent]print(i)
                    </code> 
                    
                </article>
                </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>while loop</header>
            <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        
                <code>
                    while (condition):
                    [indent]statements
                </code> 
                If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
        
                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                    the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                    tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                    control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
